## Say "Hello, World!" With Python

In this task we just have to print hello world in python. example: print(Hello, World!)

## Python If-Else

the task is given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:
* if n is odd, print **Weird**
* If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print **Not Weird**
* If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print **Weird**
* If n is even and greater than 20, print **Not Weird**

The input will be a single line containing an integer, n.

## Arithmetic Operations

The task provide code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:
* The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
* The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
* The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

## Python: Division

The task provide code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.
Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b. The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b.
No rounding or formatting is necessary.

## Loops 

The task provide code stub reads and integer, n, from STDIN. For all non-negative integers i < n, print i^2.
